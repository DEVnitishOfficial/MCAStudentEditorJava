what is JSP
```
JSP (JavaServer Pages) is a server-side technology for building dynamic web pages by embedding Java code in HTML.

JSPs allow you to mix HTML and Java code, enabling dynamic content generation on the server. They are essentially HTML pages with embedded Java code, which is executed on the server when a user requests the page

what is servlet
